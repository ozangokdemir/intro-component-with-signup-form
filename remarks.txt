problem : when adding a p element underneath form inputs on the layout, the signup form gets extended vertically, causing trial btn to stick to it instead of keeping a fixed distance from it.
solution :
- form flex behaviour changed from space-between to center
- added a margin-bottom to trial button

problem : p element is added after the margin of each input element, which is too far from the position needed
solution :
- replace bottom margins with top margins
- adjust first and last input elements margin

problem : adding an element with after doesn't allow to change its position.
solution :
- created a span under each input in html. It stays empty until an error is detected.
STILL DOESN'T THINK IT'S THE BEST SOLUTION
